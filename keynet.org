Separate Identity from mapping

* Identity Mapping (key directory part)
* Mappings
- Identity? => typed domain/email -> key
- Binaries: Download URL -> hash
- Commitments/Promises: Download URL
- DNSSEC: Domain -> SSL Cert
- HSTS: Domain -> yes

* General Semantic Rules
- identity required to change entry
- n of m identities required to update an entry
- time must pass before next update can be made (commitment)
